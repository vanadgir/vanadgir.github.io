  <p> Processing is an incredible application, allowing users to create amazing visuals in both 2D and 3D with just some
    knowledge of Java. In this blog series, I will be documenting my learning journey, both to "think aloud" as
    well as to share the cool things I make. If you'd like to follow along and learn with me, go ahead and <a
      href="https://processing.org/download" target="_blank">download</a> Processing on your machine.</p>

  <p> Before I begin, let me also shout out two amazing resources I've been using to learn. It's always good to read the
    docs - and Processing has pretty high quality ones - but this journey has been made so much more fun thanks to <a
      href="https://twitter.com/shiffman" target="_blank">Daniel Shiffman</a> and his channel <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain" target="_blank">The Coding Train</a>. You'll see his name on a lot
    of the Processing docs, and he has put an insane amount of effort into making hundreds of videos to teach you the
    fundamentals of Processing and even programming in general. In particular, I watched almost the entirety of his <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH" target="_blank">Coding
      Challenges</a> playlist, and I still refer back to a handful of them when trying to brainstorm new creations. </p>

  <p>The other creator I must thank is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thedotisblack"
      target="_blank">thedotisblack</a>. On his channel, you can dive right into some incredibly cool animations and see
    how he makes them. I've picked up a few neat tricks from what he's shared and I'm sure I will be inspired by him
    again. Sometimes when I am stumped, I'll just browse through his videos to remind myself of the kinds of things I
    hope to create and hop right back in!</p>

  <p>Since I am still pretty early in my journey, there are bound to be other resources and creators I find along the
    way. If you
    come across any art or artist you'd like to share with me, feel free to send me a message or email!</p>

  <p>Now... let's get to it!</p>

<div class="page-2">
  <div id="title">
    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <br>

  <br>
  <p> When creating animations with Processing, there are two core functions that need to be invoked - <i>setup()</i>
    and
    <i>draw()</i>. In the <i>setup()</i> function, we can do things like set the canvas dimensions, assign values to
    global variables,
    instantiate objects for later manipulation, and any other steps that need to happen on or before the first frame.
    Then,
    in <i>draw()</i>, we can apply transformations, scaling, variable recalculation, and lots more to bring the canvas
    to life.
    Each unit of time in our case here is a single frame, or one whole execution of the <i>draw()</i> function.
  </p>

  <pre><code>    
    // setup function
    void setup() {
      size(600, 600);
      background(0);
      ellipse(width/2, height/2, 100, 100);
    }
    
    // render function
    void draw() {
      // what do we want to make happen?
    }
  </code></pre>

  <p>In this example, we're setting our canvas to 600px by 600px and giving it a black background. Although the default
    color mode is RGB and usually requires 3 values, we can shorthand black and white with 0 and 255 respectively. When
    creating the ellipse, you'll notice I used variables called <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> without ever creating or
    assigning them. That's because Processing holds on to a number of system variables as well - <i>width</i> and
    <i>height</i> being the dimensions of the canvas itself. By setting the center of the ellipse to half the width and
    height of the canvas, we ensure it will be centered in our view even if we were to set the dimensions to something
    other than (600, 600). </p>

  <center> <img src="./images/post1_1.png" title="White Circle Black Background"> </center> <br>

  <p>We've drawn our first shape to the canvas! Now to make it do something interesting. Why not make it slide to the
    right and then wrap back around to the left side for a simple and satisfying loop? Here's how we might achieve that.
  </p>

  <pre><code>    
    int x, y;
    int speed = 5;
    
    // setup function
    void setup() {
      size(600, 600);
      background(0);
      x = width/2;
      y = height/2;
    }
    
    // render function
    void draw() {
      ellipse(x, y, 100, 100);
      x += speed;
      if (x >= width) {
        x = 0;
      }
    }
  </code></pre>

  <p>Now, we initialize some variables globally, since we would like to change them later on within the <i>draw()</i>
    scope. The variables <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are set to half the width and height so that we can simplify our
    formulas, while <i>speed</i> is set to an arbitrary value of 5. We can play with this one to adjust how quickly the
    circle will slide. </p>

  <p>This time around, we create our ellipse within <i>draw()</i> because we want to be able to change where we place it
    and draw its new location each frame. We also add a check for when <i>x</i> goes beyond the width of the canvas,
    setting it back to 0 which would send it back to the left side. Everything seems about right, so then how does it
    look? </p>

  <center> <img src="./images/post1_2.gif" title="White Circle Trail Gif"> </center> <br>

  <p>Wait a second... ah, that's right. Currently, when we draw new frames, they are being overlaid on each other and creating this trailing effect. It looks cool, but wasn't quite what we wanted. Luckily, this is an easy fix.</p>

  <pre><code>    
    int x, y;
    int speed = 5;
    
    // setup function
    void setup() {
      size(600, 600);
      background(0);
      x = width/2;
      y = height/2;
    }
    
    // render function
    void draw() {
      background(0);
      ellipse(x, y, 100, 100);
      x += speed;
      if (x >= width) {
        x = 0;
      }
    }
  </code></pre>

  <p>All that is needed here is a <i>background(0)</i> in the render loop. Now, before new circles are drawn, the entire canvas will be set to a black background again. This should now give us the desired effect. </p>

  <center> <img src="./images/post1_3.gif" title="White Circle Motion Gif"> </center> <br>

  <p>Excellent!</p>

  <p>As we'll see in later entries, both methods can be utilised depending on the context and type of effect we are going for. Next time, we'll look at the <i>map()</i> function for rescaling values as well as the <i>random()</i> function for some of its clever uses. Thanks for reading and see you in the next one!</p>

  <p>Now that we have a basic grasp of the two core functions and getting a shape on screen, why not try to make something truly generative? One of the first examples I learned was to create a raining effect, so let's go through that together. Let's first try and get a basic shape to fall from the top of the screen to the bottom, and then extend that logic.</p>

  <pre><code>    
    float x, y; // starting position of the shape
    float len = 10; // length of the shape
    float speed = 5; // fall speed
  
    void setup() {
      size(600, 480);
      x = width/2;
      y = 0;
    }
    
    void draw() {
      background(200);
      strokeWeight(4);
      stroke(0, 0, 200);
      line(x, y, x, y+len);
      y += speed;
    }
  </code></pre>

  <center> <img src="./images/post2_1.gif" title="Single Raindrop Gif"> </center> <br>

  <p>This gives us a line segment drawn in the center of the screen with weight 4, and it falls at a rate of 5 pixels per frame. If we want to extend this to mimic falling rain, then we can use this basic behavior in the form of a Drop class. To do this in Processing, we just create a new tab and name it Drop. Instead of creating global variables in our main file, we can instead have these be inherent properties of a Drop. At time of creation, we can assign a Drop a new starting height, fall speed, stroke weight, or really anything we want.  </p>

  <pre><code>    
    class Drop {
      float x = random(width); // random horizontal position
      float y = random(-500, -100); // random height, can be offscreen
      float z = random(0, 20); // create sense of depth
      float len = map(z, 0, 20, 10, 20); // length of Drop
      float yspeed = map(z, 0, 20, 4, 10); // speed of Drop

      // fall & reset method
      void fall() {
        y = y + yspeed;
    
        if (y > height) {
          y = random(-200, -100);
          yspeed = map(z, 0, 20, 4, 10);
        }
      }
    
      // display method
      void show() {
        float thick = map(z, 0, 20, 1, 3);
        strokeWeight(thick);
        stroke(0, 0, 200);
        line(x, y, x, y+len);
      }
    }
  </code></pre>

  <p>Two functions are doing a lot of the heavy lifting in here - <i>random()</i> and <i>map()</i>. The <i>random()</i> function gives us a number in the given range of two arguments, or a number from 0 to the given single argument. It is being used in this class for multiple purposes, such as giving the Drop a random starting position, both horizontally and vertically. These values are such that a new Drop may start well offscreen before passing through the visible canvas. The value of <i>z</i> here lets us do some neat tricks to create a sense of depth despite rendering in 2D, with the use of the <i>map()</i> function. To use this function, we tell it a value, its original range, and then the new range to which to scale it. This means we can take the value of <i>z</i> and use it to inform multiple features of the Drop, like its stroke weight and fall speed, allowing us to give each Drop a separated, staggered animation for falling.</p>

  <p>Now that we've defined the class and its methods, we can go back to our main script to initialize, draw, and update a large number of Drops. Since most of our behavior and logic is stored in the Drop class, we should have pretty simple <i>setup()</i> and <i>draw()</i> functions.</p>

  <pre><code>    
    // initialize array of 500 Drop objects
    Drop[] drops = new Drop[500];
    
    // setup function 
    void setup() {
      size(600, 480);

      // loop through and create a new Drop for every index
      for (int i = 0; i < drops.length; i++) {
        drops[i] = new Drop();
      }
    }
    
    // render function
    void draw() {
      background(200);

      // each frame, show and update the new location
      for (int i = 0; i < drops.length; i++) {
        drops[i].show();
        drops[i].fall();
      }
    }
  </code></pre>

  <p>If you were to run this in Processing, it would appear to rain endlessly. Unfortunately, having to export to gif means I have to use a limited number of frames. In fact, this may even motivate a shift over to p5.js at some point, the Javascript library built to support a lot of the same functionality as Processing. However, before moving on, there are still more fundamentals to Processing to discuss!</p>

  <p>Now that we've built and utilized a Class, we can certainly imagine how dynamic some of our creations can be. Just like <i>random()</i> and <i>map()</i>, there are lots of functions available to us that are simple in concept, yet lead to awesome results. Next time, we'll take a look at involving a morphing color palette. Additionally, we'll even try to solve the problem of having limited frames for gif uploads - is there a way we can ensure a smooth loop in a limited frame count?</p>

  <p>Thanks for reading and see you next time!</p>
