  <h3>Day 4: </h3>

      <p> Finally - rest day. Although, like any other day, we got into the car first thing in the morning, the key difference today would be the short 10 minute drive to Hot Springs downtown. A nice, quiet town with a lot of history, it was our first experience actually out and about in a new place. What a great idea to dodge the storm in Kentucky - the weather here was beautiful. </p>

      <p> You can actually get drinking water straight from the hot springs that give the town its name. Full of minerals and just under boiling temp, something about it was extremely satisfying. Locals and visitors alike gathered around the literal watering hole to fill their jugs and cartons, and later on during our walk, we found another fountain sourced from a cool water spring. </p>

      <p> At one time a popular vacation spot for American elite, Hot Springs AK is famous for its bathhouses. On Bathhouse Row, you can find a number of old buildings, some of which retain their architecture but have been repurposed into lodging or eateries, while a couple of others are still actively in business as bathhouses. Unfortunately for us, they only provide their bath and massage services from Thursday to Sunday, and it was Wednesday. Unlucky, but it's fine. This just means the massage after the trip will be that much better. </p>

      <p> We went up a short but steep trail to the Hot Springs Mountain Tower, where we got a nice 360 view of the surrounding area. Kind of reminded me of the view from Sugarloaf back in Sunderland MA. Funnily enough, there's another Sugarloaf here in Hot Springs. See if you can spot the rollercoaster/theme park among the trees in the first pic. </p>

      <p> On our way back down from the observation tower, we actually caught a glimpse of some of the spring water pouring through cracks in the stones, creating a small pool. This was very nice, because of our incorrect initial assumption that a place called Hot Springs would have large outdoor hot springs. A consolation prize. </p>

      <p> After a great day of walking around town and some light hiking, we treated ourselves to some pizza and beer at the Grateful Head. The rest of the night would be fairly low-key, taking extra time to make sure all of our stuff was packed. The next day would be a significant bit of driving again - New Mexico to be the goal. </p>
