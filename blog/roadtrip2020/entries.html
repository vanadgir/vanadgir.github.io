  <p> And we're off! My travelmates came by to pick me up just after noon, and our first stop was... my parent's house!
    Since our first major stop on the trip was Philly to see my brother, I couldn't possibly leave without
    bringing him some of mom's homecooked food. After chatting and getting some last minute travel tips from my parents,
    we left for real. </p>
  <p> It's a pretty normal drive, one I've done a number of times with my family already. In fact, the drive went even
    more smoothly than I had expected. For some reason, I was under the impression the drive to Philly would be
    around 6 hours, but in fact it's closer to 4.5. We just stopped once in New Haven, after which I took to the wheel
    to bring us the rest of the way to my brother's new place. </p>

        title="Me and bro after dinner"> </a> </center> <br>

  <p> Upon reaching his apartment, I had to admit to the rest that I hadn't eaten yet. It must have been how late I
    stayed up the night before and just my general sense of excitement, but yeah - it occurred to me shortly before
    arriving that I was actually very hungry. Fortunately, my brother and I have made it a habit to get halal food
    cart every time I visit, and this time was no exception. After picking up our dinner, we continued walking
    around Philly to a spot called Cira Green. It's a nice little park on a roof with music, a large TV screen,
    spots for picnicking, and a good view of the streets below. </p>


  <p> After eating, it was time to vibe out back at the apartment. The thing about hanging out with a brother you
    don't get to see often - you don't even necessarily have to be doing anything in particular to enjoy the time
    together. We had some drinks, talked about our plans for the rest of our trip / his semester, watched some bad
    movies, and eventually slept after a fun night together. </p>

  <p> Our first big stretch of driving was going to be the next day... </p>

  <p> Not too many pictures taken today. After all, it was a long 11.5 hour drive to Cave City, KY - most of which I
    spent in the back seat resting up for my turn. We drove through Columbus and Cincinnati, OH, where I eventually took
    night shift and got us to the motel in Kentucky. Definitely not as homey as my brother's place. However, we had
    officially passed through into Central Time! </p>

  <center> <a href="./images/day2_1.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="./images/day2_1.jpg" width=50% height=50%
        title="Cave City, KY"> </a> </center> <br>

  <p> And honestly, that's about it. We called it a night as soon as we got there and prepared for a shorter, but still
    significant, drive the next day. Unfortunately for our Mammoth Cave plans, we found out that a large storm would be
    passing through the area. Not wanting to get stuck in the thunder, lightning, and poor driving conditions that would
    accompany it, we chose to just push on ahead. Funnily enough, that same storm ended up passing through MA and
    visited our friends and family back home. </p>

  <p> In the morning, our complimentary breakfast consisted of a granola bar, an apple, a cinnamon cake, and a bottle of
    water. Since the motel couldn't provide breakfast in their lobby, they were simply handing out lunchbags of assorted
    breakfast things. Not particularly excited about the foodstuffs they included, we decided that there's no reason to
    turn down free drinking water for a long trip, so we took our lunchbags and headed to get breakfast at a Cracker
    Barrel nearby.
  <p>

  <p> It was okay. The real highlight was seeing someone open carrying while paying for their breakfast. Wouldn't want
    to be anywhere near that man's bacon, that's for sure. </p>

  <p> Now I know I cheated a little bit by including today's breakfast in yesterday's post, but that's just how
    uneventful yesterday was. Today, we have pictures again! Following breakfast, we began on our 4.5 hour drive down to
    Memphis, TN, a place known for Elvis, rock & roll, blues, and the lively Beale St. </p>

  <center> <a href="./images/day3_1.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="./images/day3_1.jpg" height=75% width=75%
        title='"Lively" Beale St'> </a> </center> <br>

  <p> Ah right, we're in a pandemic. While disappointing that the streets weren't full of people and the sound of music,
    it was a uniquely bizarre and special experience being one of just a handful of groups of people there. And lucky
    for us, the sound of music wasn't missing for long. </p>

  <p> In a little cutout next to King's Palace Cafe, there was a live band playing the blues to a small crowd of people
    - socially distanced at separate tables, of course. What a find this was! It made me realize just how long it had
    been since my last live show, which honestly I can't remember. It might have been Marc Rebillet at the Sinclair? I
    dunno. </p>

        title="King's Palace Cafe Patio"> </a> </center> <br>

  <p> Seriously, I can't tell you just how awesome it was, to be able to just relax with a beer and listen to some live
    blues outdoors. On this unusually quiet street, there were still people trying to liven things up, and doing it as
    safely as they could. After a beer and a few jams, we decided it was time to head back to the car to continue the
    drive to Arkansas, making sure to tip the band as we left. </p>

  <p> On our way back to the car, we also found a little music shop. I bought my first vinyl (Radiohead - OK Computer
    OKNOTOK), and a couple of gifts for musician friends back home. It would be a couple of days before I realized, "Oh,
    yeah, I should get a record player, huh?" We also made sure to say bye to Elvis before leaving. </p>

  <p> The drive to Hot Springs, AK would be another 3 hours from Memphis. It was evening/night shift, so my turn to
    drive now. It was a fairly quiet drive for the majority of it, elevating to hauntingly quiet as we reached closer to
    Hot Springs. For about 45 minutes off of the interstate, we just went down winding roads to get to our inn. </p>

        title="Hot Springs, AK"> </a> </center> <br>

  <p> Once we arrived at our room, we decided it would be a good idea to stay here for two nights. We had just spent two
    very long days driving - why not stay and enjoy Hot Springs National Park and get a chance to sleep in for a night?
    Once suggested, it was heartily agreed upon by everyone, and so we hopped in bed, excited to not have to drive the
    next day. </p>

  <p> Finally - rest day. Although, like any other day, we got into the car first thing in the morning, the key
    difference today would be the short 10 minute drive to Hot Springs downtown. A nice, quiet town with a lot of
    history, it was our first experience actually out and about in a new place. What a great idea to dodge the storm in
    Kentucky - the weather here was beautiful. </p>

  <center> <a href="./images/day4_1.jpeg" target="_blank"> <img src="./images/day4_1.jpeg" height=75% width=75%
        title="Hot Springs on tap"> </a> </center> <br>

  <p> You can actually get drinking water straight from the hot springs that give the town its name. Full of minerals
    and just under boiling temp, something about it was extremely satisfying. Locals and visitors alike gathered around
    the literal watering hole to fill their jugs and cartons, and later on during our walk, we found another fountain
    sourced from a cool water spring. </p>

        title="Still in business"> </a> </center> <br>

  <p> At one time a popular vacation spot for American elite, Hot Springs AK is famous for its bathhouses. On Bathhouse
    Row, you can find a number of old buildings, some of which retain their architecture but have been repurposed into
    lodging or eateries, while a couple of others are still actively in business as bathhouses. Unfortunately for us,
    they only provide their bath and massage services from Thursday to Sunday, and it was Wednesday. Unlucky, but it's
    fine. This just means the massage after the trip will be that much better. </p>

  <p> We went up a short but steep trail to the Hot Springs Mountain Tower, where we got a nice 360 view of the
    surrounding area. Kind of reminded me of the view from Sugarloaf back in Sunderland MA. Funnily enough, there's
    another Sugarloaf here in Hot Springs. See if you can spot the rollercoaster/theme park among the trees in the first
    pic. </p>

  <p> On our way back down from the observation tower, we actually caught a glimpse of some of the spring water pouring
    through cracks in the stones, creating a small pool. This was very nice, because of our incorrect initial assumption
    that a place called Hot Springs would have large outdoor hot springs. A consolation prize. </p>

  <p> After a great day of walking around town and some light hiking, we treated ourselves to some pizza and beer at the
    Grateful Head. The rest of the night would be fairly low-key, taking extra time to make sure all of our stuff was
    packed. The next day would be a significant bit of driving again - New Mexico to be the goal. </p>

  <p> After a full day to ourselves, free from driving, we hit the road again with a renewed vigor. Before the trip, we
    had questions on how we would handle long stretches of driving, but after making it this far, we knew there was
    nothing to worry about. Our first stop today was Dallas, about 4.5 hours from Hot Springs and a good spot to stop
    for lunch. The hottest day yet, we finally hit 33 C (91 F) as we entered the Texas border. </p>

  <center> <a href="./images/day5_1.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="./images/day5_1.jpg" height=50% width=50%
        title="Dallas, TX"> </a> </center> <br>

  <p> Our stop for lunch was a place called Pepe & Mito's, a local Tex-Mex restaurant that did not disappoint. I would
    have taken a picture of my chimichanga, but I ate it too fast. We walked around for a little bit to take in the heat
    and the fact that we had made it down to Texas and were nearing the meat of our trip. Back in 2011 or 12, I had done
    the drive from MA to Fort Worth with another friend, so it was very cool how I could recognize some of the highways
    and scenery. </p>

  <p> The next leg of the trip was completely new for me, and it would be approximately 7 hours to Carlsbad, NM. This
    drive was one of the best of the trip - fields of wind turbines as far as the eye can see, an orange sunset in the
    distance, and barely any traffic. And the scenery was no less amazing once we hit nighttime, either, since all the
    wind turbines in the distance turned into little red flashing lights. At one point, the entire horizon became a
    dotted line of little warning lights blinking in sync with each other. </p>

  <p> When we got off the main interstate, it was rather surprising that this new single lane highway still had a speed
    limit of 75. Out here were fields of oil rigs and exhaust pipes that looked like massive candles, which could be
    seen flickering from miles away since there were no streetlights. As we passed into New Mexico, our scenery did not
    change at all. However, as we got closer to our destination, we passed through some small towns every so often. It
    was at the edge of one of these small towns that we found our night's lodging - Karbani Inn. </p>

  <p> What appeared to be a metal box in the middle of nowhere, was the genius that was Karbani Inn. A bunch of metal
    shipping containers repurposed with plumbing and electricity, it was honestly a very cozy accommodation. We spent
    the night planning our stops for the next few days, while drinking beers under a clear night sky. It wasn't too long
    before we were visited by a cute furry friend. </p>

  <center> <a href="./images/day5_4.jpeg" target="_blank"> <img src="./images/day5_4.jpeg" height=75% width=75%

  <p> Initially surprised that we would run into what appeared to be a very well-fed stray, we found out later it was
    actually the owner's cat. Despite our offerings of chips, crackers, and pieces of fruit, he was focused on getting
    into one of the trash bins. Meowing non-stop, he finally made it to the McDonald's bag in the trash, only to find
    out it was empty. Perhaps too ashamed to accept our snacks after that, he left after a few more meows. Ultimately,
    we decided we would drive through Lincoln National Forest to get to White Sands National Park the next day. </p>

  <p> After a tasty breakfast burrito from the food cart near the Inn, we set off. </p>

  <p> Happy October! </p>

  <p> Despite waking up slightly late today, we still managed to make good time leaving Karbani Inn. We'd be driving
    through some winding mountain paths today, so we made sure to use our daylight hours well. Our first stop would be
    Cloudcroft, NM, a small village up in Lincoln National Forest where people like to ski and enjoy the mountain views.
  </p>

  <center> <a href="./images/day6_1.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="./images/day6_1.jpg" height=50% width=50%
        title="Carlsbad, NM"> </a> </center> <br>

  <p> Only 2.5 hours out of Carlsbad, the drive was beautiful. After driving through the flat terrain of Texas, it was
    wonderful to be back up in higher elevation. Since we wanted to spend most of our day at White Sands, we didn't stop
    to check out the town or the hiking spots around here, but we did go to one of the viewpoints up there. Sierra
    Blanca Viewpoint up in Cloudcroft gives a great view over to Sierra Blanca's peak, which is about 30 miles away.
  </p>

        title="Sierra Blanca Viewpoint"> </a> </center> <br>

  <p> The drive back down the other side of Lincoln National Forest was a nice break for our little car, as it could be
    heard struggling up some of the steep grades earlier. The views of the mountainside and beyond were marvelous -
    while New England surely does have mountain views and hiking, the views down below are certainly not the same.
    Rather than the trees and hills we have at home, the sights below were sand and desert. The ride from Cloudcroft
    down to White Sands was just under an hour. Although we could see hints of the white sand as we approached the park
    entrance, we didn't quite grasp the scale of it until we got into the park itself. </p>

  <center> <a href="./images/day6_3.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="./images/day6_3.jpg" height=75% width=75%

        title="Pure White Field of View"> </a> </center> <br>

  <p> Needless to say, this park was one of the first awe-inspiring visits of the trip thus far. Never had I seen
    anything like this. The day was brutally hot, yet the white sand was cool to the touch. Visitors were sledding down
    the dunes, families were having picnics, and the general atmosphere here was magical. Depending where you got out of
    your car, the entire horizon would be white. And on a day like today, there was hardly a cloud in the sky. We spent
    a good few hours in the picnic area, snacking on fruit and crackers and thinking about where we wanted to go next.
  </p>

  <p> It was at this time we had our first communication breakdown. When we started to realize that it would simply not
    be possible to hit all of our planned spots in the remaining days of the trip, it became difficult deciding which
    places to cut and which to keep. An awkward silence lingered over our group as we slowly finished our snacks, and we
    eventually decided to put off the final decision until we reached Albuquerque. A decent midpoint between our
    remaining route options, Albuquerque was a reasonable place to stop for the night. </p>

  <p> The drive to Albuquerque was about 4 hours from White Sands, and fortunately for us, it was a full harvest moon
    tonight. Not only did we get a beautiful sunset, but shortly after, we got to witness the cresting of the moon along
    the mountain range on the horizon. It was enormous, and I only wish we were able to get a picture of it. Thankfully,
    this sight did raise our spirits a bit from earlier. After getting dinner at Cheba Hut Toasted Subs in Albuquerque,
    we called it for the night and decided to plan our day in the morning. </p>

  <p> After some discussion in the morning, we eventually decided that the Petrified Forest was a stop we could not
    miss, although we would still have to skip the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park. Unfortunate, but it would was a
    necessary sacrifice to make good time on the rest of the trip. From Albuquerque, the trip would be about 3.5 hours
    along the historic Route 66, now I-40. The Petrified Forest is actually found within a larger landmark known as the
    Painted Desert. Aptly named, the layers of sand and stone had shades of blue/lavender, red/orange, grey, and likely
    more at other strata. Honestly, it's hard to put into words the beauty and wonder of this place, so I'll just let
    the pictures speak for themselves. Enjoy. </p>

  <p> I wish I had more to say about the Painted Desert / Petrified Forest, other than to go there if you ever have the
    chance. Despite the number of hours we spent there, there was still more we could have seen, but unfortunately we
    had to prepare to leave since the park was preparing to close soon. At the picnic area near the exit, we took some
    time to make noodles on our portable propane stove - it was quite the janky setup. But there's something special
    about the taste of roadside noodles made in a rush. </p>

  <p> Our next stop was Canyonlands in Utah, so we started our approximately 4 hour drive. This night gave us a bit of a
    scare, since we were struggling to find lodging. Every place we called was completely booked and meant that we would
    have to continue driving into the night. Finally, in Blanding, UT, we were able to secure the final two rooms at the
    Four Corners Inn. Up until now, I could safely that the Petrified Forest was my favourite stop of the trip. It
    wouldn't be long for something to rival it, though, since tomorrow we would be seeing Canyonlands. </p>

  <p> Good morning, Utah! To be completely honest, I had no idea what was in store for the day. Of course, I've looked
    at pictures of popular parks and landscapes around the United States, but they had always existed as isolated spots
    in my brain. It wasn't until this trip that I actually understood the scale and how they connected. Utah is
    humongous, and everywhere you look there are mountains, whether near or in the distance. In our excitement to
    explore the Canyonlands, we didn't realize right away that our GPS target wasn't quite where we wanted to go (we
    just put in "Canyonlands" and went where it took us lol). No doubt, it was spectacular. Our altitude dropped
    significantly as we drove through these cliffs, but this was primarily a hiking and climbing area for people with
    serious gear. We drove around the south end of the park for a couple hours before circling back. </p>

  <p> On the way to Moab, we saw signs for Wilson Arch, a sandstone structure named after Joe Wilson, a pioneer who
    lived nearby. It was impossible to miss, and we decided it would be a fun stop to walk around and hike for a little
    bit. </p>

  <p> There were a lot of families enjoying the simpler approaches, meanwhile other daredevils were belaying each other
    down from the top of the arch. We hiked up to the base of the arch and enjoyed the shade and the company of someone
    else's dog, looking out at the view. It was really cool how this was right along the highway, no official entrance,
    no line to get in, just nature. After spending about an hour up here, we continued on to Moab. </p>

  <p> Moab is a neat little town. In some ways, it reminded me a little bit of Northampton, MA. We stopped for food in
    town and to top up on some supplies, and also got some extra food to-go for dinner since we were still considering
    camping somewhere potentially. On the way to Island in the Sky, we also drove up to Arches National Park. However,
    once we saw the approach from down below, we decided it was not something the car would be able to handle. I think
    maybe we could have done it, but it will remain one of the trip's unanswered questions. </p>

  <p> Hello from Island in the Sky. There aren't many selfies from this trip, so I hope you extra enjoy this one. The
    entire park exists on a large plateau from which you can view all of the surrounding area. Once you go through the
    park entrance, there are just miles of cliffside road. Serpentining through these roads was an exhilerating
    experience, as a lot of the curves had no guardrails. You simply had to control your vehicle's speed and turn
    carefully. Every so often, there were viewpoints to stop at, which we did. I even got to climb a few rocks for
    better views. </p>

  <p> After taking in the whole park, we reminded ourselves that we still needed to look into the possibility of camping
    somewhere, if that was still our plan. To no one's surprise, all of the camping spots within the park had been
    reserved. While there are some free campgrounds along highways, they are also first come first serve, meaning they
    are generally packed if you aren't there well before sundown. Our plan to camp would not pan out, so we chose to
    drive onward to Provo, UT - just south of Salt Lake City. On the way, we decided if we couldn't camp, we could at
    least have dinner outside as the sun set. And where better to do that than on the side of a single lane highway?

  <p> After a quick meal, we drove on. Tomorrow, we'd be checking out the Salt Lake itself before taking on a huge drive
    over to Reno, NV. The end of the trip was closing in fast. </p>

  <p> Before embarking on the long journey to Reno, we stopped at Penny Ann's Cafe for a hearty breakfast, and even had
    to pack our remaining pancakes to go. Afterwards, we went to the Great Salt Lake itself to check out the marina and
    the beach. Looking at reviews of the place, there was a common theme of "it's nice but it smells awful," and boy did
    it live up to that. Lots of the beach had dried up and large colonies of tiny flies carpeted the sand. Taking steps
    through the sand caused them all to disperse in sync, almost like dust in the wind. Check out my second selfie of
    the trip. </p>

        title="Another selfie"> </a> </center> <br>

  <p> As we returned to our car to head out, we started talking to an older couple that was cleaning their RV in the
    parking lot. We clearly looked like travelers, and they were amazed we were here from so far away. It was nice to
    talk to some local folks and drop the "us and them". Honestly, that's one of the biggest lessons from this trip.
    News and social media tend to feed us a lot of negativity, but there really are normal people everywhere. Hopefully
    we don't forget that. </p>

  <p> Back in the car, we prepared for a long 8ish hour drive. Normally, I had been taking the evening/night shift for
    driving, but today I wanted to drive first. With the sun beating down through the driver side window, I got us about
    4-5 hours through the trip in almost a single shot. The speed limit for a lot of this highway was 80 mph. Now don't
    tell anyone, but I miiiiight have hit 110 mph at one point. After the mountains in Utah, there was a large stretch
    of just pure desert. For miles and miles, nothing could be seen in the distance except for more road. </p>

  <p> Come nighttime, we made it to Reno, NV. We joked about wanting to go do some penny slots and $1 blackjack, but
    truthfully, we were way too tired to do anything like that. Instead, we found a nice spot for dinner with a lot of
    different options. I got myself an authentic and delicious thali at a place called... Thali. With one payment, I got
    free roti and rice refills with my amazing plate of food. </p>

  <p> After dinner, we called it for the night. Tomorrow would be our final day of exploration and adventure, so we
    wanted to be fully awake and ready. </p>

  <p> From Reno, we headed out for Lake Tahoe. Right on the border of NV and CA, we would officially be passing into
    California today. We made plans to pick up breakfast from Ernie's Coffee Shop, a busy spot among all the other
    attractions in Tahoe and about an hour away. After arriving and picking up our food, we entered into the actual park
    areas, and sat down to eat along the water at Pope Beach. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever see water as clear as
    what you can find here at Lake Tahoe. Even as the light waves splashed up onto shore, the view of the bottom was
    completely clean and unobstructed. </p>

  <p> We sat and enjoyed the water here for about an hour before cleaning up to go drive around the loop a bit more.
    Around the lake are many hiking and beach spots, so our plan was to drive clockwise for a bit, staying on the
    California side. Occasionally, we'd stop at viewpoints along the way, sometimes even trekking into the woods further
    just for fun. It was pretty busy up here for a Monday, at least to my untrained eye. Perhaps it should be even more
    busy here were it not for the pandemic. We passed a number of large houses built along the mountainside, likely
    priced at several millions. Something tells me those houses are worth every penny, considering the views here. </p>

  <p> We continued on to Meek's Bay, another beach, where we sat on the rocks for another half hour. It was a great
    relaxing experience, meditating there. Taking in all the sounds of this wonderful place, it was very calming and
    helped to round out and balance the exciting and hectic past few days. After we took it all in, we decided it was
    time to continue. </p>

  <p> The last leg of our trip would take us through the mountains, with lots of warning signs for the steep grades we'd
    have to endure. The car groaned as some points, but it was only a little bit farther now. At one point, we got stuck
    in traffic due to two completely independent accidents. One car with a few minor dents had pulled over on the side
    of the road, waiting for some sort of assistance. However, he was going to have to wait - further down the road was
    a massive accident involving an 18-wheeler. The front of this truck appeared to have exploded - metal pieces lay
    strewn all over the road and the parts of the truck that were still intact were charred and black. It took a while
    to make it past, but once we did, it was smooth sailing. </p>

  <p> Our trip finally came to a close 3.5 hours later, when we arrived in Oakland. We pulled in to our Airbnb and took
    a while to finally realize that the trip was over. It was honestly a bit sad, as the last few days had been some of
    the most spectacular of the trip. I was still riding the high of being able to see so much of the country I'd been
    waiting to see, and so it was tough to accept that I'd be heading home soon. But arriving here was not all bad!
    Tomorrow would be my free day here in the Bay Area, and so I'd made plans to borrow the car and see some other
    friends. </p>

  <p> Technically Day 11: </p>

  <p> On my free day, I met with one of our family friends for lunch, and then met with two of my online friends for
    dinner. In between, I stopped by Presidio Park in San Francisco, hoping to get some sort of view of the Golden Gate
    Bridge. Unfortunately, it was an extremely foggy day, so all I could hear were the sounds of the ocean waves and
    occasional fog horns. Not a big deal - I'd already seen the Golden Gate Bridge a few times on previous trips, and
    the park had a certain charm of its own when shrouded in fog. I arrived back at the Airbnb in the middle of the
    night and went straight to bed. Tomorrow would be a day of no schedule, no driving, and relaxing only. Well, and
    packing for my flight the following day. </p>

  <p> And so that brings my trip to a close. After a short, bittersweet plane ride back to MA, I met up with my parents.
    The first thing I did upon arriving home was to take a shower, trying to keep whatever germs I'd brought from across
    the country to a minimum. We enjoyed a nice dinner together and I shared a lot of the pictures I shared with you all
    here. </p>

  <h3><b><u>National Parks Visited: </b></u></h3>
  <p> 1. Hot Springs National Park </br>
    2. White Sands National Park </br>
    3. Petrified Forest National Park (Painted Desert) </br>
    4. Canyonlands National Park (Island in the Sky) </br> </p>

  <h3><b><u>Other Landmarks Visited: </b></u></h3>
  <p> 1. Beale Street, Memphis TN </br>
    2. Lincoln National Forest </br>
    3. Great Salt Lake </br>
    4. Tahoe National Forest </br> </p>

  <p> So after a collective <b>~70 hours</b> of driving, passing through <b>15 states</b>, and approximately <b>4.9k
      miles</b> traveled, I can now say that I've driven across the country. This is an experience I recommend to anyone
    and everyone, especially if you've only lived in a coastal city. The country is enormous and, though I'd seen
    pictures and read about them, these sights and landmarks always felt so distant until now. I will absolutely be
    doing a trip like this again, hopefully sooner rather than later, because who knows when such an opportunity will
    come by again. I'm eternally grateful to my friends for inviting me on this trip with them, as these are memories
    that I will have forever. I hope you've enjoyed my recollection of the trip, I've certainly enjoyed reliving it
    through blogging. Hope to have some more exciting stuff for you all soon. </p>

  <p> Peace! </p>
