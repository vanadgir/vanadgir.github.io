  <h3>Day 6: </h3>

      <p> Happy October! </p>

      <p> Despite waking up slightly late today, we still managed to make good time leaving Karbani Inn. We'd be driving through some winding mountain paths today, so we made sure to use our daylight hours well. Our first stop would be Cloudcroft, NM, a small village up in Lincoln National Forest where people like to ski and enjoy the mountain views. </p>

      <p> Only 2.5 hours out of Carlsbad, the drive was beautiful. After driving through the flat terrain of Texas, it was wonderful to be back up in higher elevation. Since we wanted to spend most of our day at White Sands, we didn't stop to check out the town or the hiking spots around here, but we did go to one of the viewpoints up there. Sierra Blanca Viewpoint up in Cloudcroft gives a great view over to Sierra Blanca's peak, which is about 30 miles away. </p>

      <p> The drive back down the other side of Lincoln National Forest was a nice break for our little car, as it could be heard struggling up some of the steep grades earlier. The views of the mountainside and beyond were marvelous - while New England surely does have mountain views and hiking, the views down below are certainly not the same. Rather than the trees and hills we have at home, the sights below were sand and desert. The ride from Cloudcroft down to White Sands was just under an hour. Although we could see hints of the white sand as we approached the park entrance, we didn't quite grasp the scale of it until we got into the park itself. </p>

      <p> Needless to say, this park was one of the first awe-inspiring visits of the trip thus far. Never had I seen anything like this. The day was brutally hot, yet the white sand was cool to the touch. Visitors were sledding down the dunes, families were having picnics, and the general atmosphere here was magical. Depending where you got out of your car, the entire horizon would be white. And on a day like today, there was hardly a cloud in the sky. We spent a good few hours in the picnic area, snacking on fruit and crackers and thinking about where we wanted to go next.  </p>

      <p> It was at this time we had our first communication breakdown. When we started to realize that it would simply not be possible to hit all of our planned spots in the remaining days of the trip, it became difficult deciding which places to cut and which to keep. An awkward silence lingered over our group as we slowly finished our snacks, and we eventually decided to put off the final decision until we reached Albuquerque. A decent midpoint between our remaining route options, Albuquerque was a reasonable place to stop for the night. </p>

      <p> The drive to Albuquerque was about 4 hours from White Sands, and fortunately for us, it was a full harvest moon tonight. Not only did we get a beautiful sunset, but shortly after, we got to witness the cresting of the moon along the mountain range on the horizon. It was enormous, and I only wish we were able to get a picture of it. Thankfully, this sight did raise our spirits a bit from earlier. After getting dinner at Cheba Hut Toasted Subs in Albuquerque, we called it for the night and decided to plan our day in the morning. </p>
