  <h3>Day 1: </h3>

      <p> And we're off! My travelmates came by to pick me up just after noon, and our first stop was... my parent's house! Since our first major stop on the trip was Philly to see my brother, I couldn't possibly leave without bringing him some of mom's homecooked food. After chatting and getting some last minute travel tips from my parents, we left for real. </p>
      <p> It's a pretty normal drive, one I've done a number of times with my family already. In fact, the drive went even more smoothly than I had expected. For some reason, I was under the impression the drive to Philly would be around 6 hours, but in fact it's closer to 4.5. We just stopped once in New Haven, after which I took to the wheel to bring us the rest of the way to my brother's new place.

      <p> Upon reaching his apartment, I had to admit to the rest that I hadn't eaten yet. It must have been how late I stayed up the night before and just my general sense of excitement, but yeah - it occurred to me shortly before arriving that I was actually very hungry. Fortunately, my brother and I have made it a habit to get halal food cart every time I visit, and this time was no exception. After picking up our dinner, we continued walking around Philly to a spot called Cira Green. It's a nice little park on a roof with music, a large TV screen, spots for picnicking, and a good view of the streets below.


      <p> After eating, it was time to vibe out back at the apartment. The thing about hanging out with a brother you don't get to see often - you don't even necessarily have to be doing anything in particular to enjoy the time together. We had some drinks, talked about our plans for the rest of our trip / his semester, watched some bad movies, and eventually slept after a fun night together.

      <p> Our first big stretch of driving was going to be the next day...
