  <h3>Day 5: </h3>

      <p> After a full day to ourselves, free from driving, we hit the road again with a renewed vigor. Before the trip, we had questions on how we would handle long stretches of driving, but after making it this far, we knew there was nothing to worry about. Our first stop today was Dallas, about 4.5 hours from Hot Springs and a good spot to stop for lunch. The hottest day yet, we finally hit 33 C (91 F) as we entered the Texas border. </p>

      <p> Our stop for lunch was a place called Pepe & Mito's, a local Tex-Mex restaurant that did not disappoint. I would have taken a picture of my chimichanga, but I ate it too fast. We walked around for a little bit to take in the heat and the fact that we had made it down to Texas and were nearing the meat of our trip. Back in 2011 or 12, I had done the drive from MA to Fort Worth with another friend, so it was very cool how I could recognize some of the highways and scenery.  </p>

      <p> The next leg of the trip was completely new for me, and it would be approximately 7 hours to Carlsbad, NM. This drive was one of the best of the trip - fields of wind turbines as far as the eye can see, an orange sunset in the distance, and barely any traffic. And the scenery was no less amazing once we hit nighttime, either, since all the wind turbines in the distance turned into little red flashing lights. At one point, the entire horizon became a dotted line of little warning lights blinking in sync with each other.  </p>

      <p> When we got off the main interstate, it was rather surprising that this new single lane highway still had a speed limit of 75. Out here were fields of oil rigs and exhaust pipes that looked like massive candles, which could be seen flickering from miles away since there were no streetlights. As we passed into New Mexico, our scenery did not change at all. However, as we got closer to our destination, we passed through some small towns every so often. It was at the edge of one of these small towns that we found our night's lodging - Karbani Inn. </p>

      <p> What appeared to be a metal box in the middle of nowhere, was the genius that was Karbani Inn. A bunch of metal shipping containers repurposed with plumbing and electricity, it was honestly a very cozy accommodation. We spent the night planning our stops for the next few days, while drinking beers under a clear night sky. It wasn't too long before we were visited by a cute furry friend. </p>

      <p> Initially surprised that we would run into what appeared to be a very well-fed stray, we found out later it was actually the owner's cat. Despite our offerings of chips, crackers, and pieces of fruit, he was focused on getting into one of the trash bins. Meowing non-stop, he finally made it to the McDonald's bag in the trash, only to find out it was empty. Perhaps too ashamed to accept our snacks after that, he left after a few more meows. Ultimately, we decided we would drive through Lincoln National Forest to get to White Sands National Park the next day.  </p>

      <p> After a tasty breakfast burrito from the food cart near the Inn, we set off. </p>
