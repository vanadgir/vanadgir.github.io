  <h3>Day 8: </h3>

      <p> Good morning, Utah! To be completely honest, I had no idea what was in store for the day. Of course, I've looked at pictures of popular parks and landscapes around the United States, but they had always existed as isolated spots in my brain. It wasn't until this trip that I actually understood the scale and how they connected. Utah is humongous, and everywhere you look there are mountains, whether near or in the distance. In our excitement to explore the Canyonlands, we didn't realize right away that our GPS target wasn't quite where we wanted to go (we just put in "Canyonlands" and went where it took us lol). No doubt, it was spectacular. Our altitude dropped significantly as we drove through these cliffs, but this was primarily a hiking and climbing area for people with serious gear. We drove around the south end of the park for a couple hours before circling back. </p>

      <p> On the way to Moab, we saw signs for Wilson Arch, a sandstone structure named after Joe Wilson, a pioneer who lived nearby. It was impossible to miss, and we decided it would be a fun stop to walk around and hike for a little bit. </p>

      <p> There were a lot of families enjoying the simpler approaches, meanwhile other daredevils were belaying each other down from the top of the arch. We hiked up to the base of the arch and enjoyed the shade and the company of someone else's dog, looking out at the view. It was really cool how this was right along the highway, no official entrance, no line to get in, just nature. After spending about an hour up here, we continued on to Moab.  </p>

      <p> Moab is a neat little town. In some ways, it reminded me a little bit of Northampton, MA. We stopped for food in town and to top up on some supplies, and also got some extra food to-go for dinner since we were still considering camping somewhere potentially. On the way to Island in the Sky, we also drove up to Arches National Park. However, once we saw the approach from down below, we decided it was not something the car would be able to handle. I think maybe we could have done it, but it will remain one of the trip's unanswered questions.  </p>

      <p> Hello from Island in the Sky. There aren't many selfies from this trip, so I hope you extra enjoy this one. The entire park exists on a large plateau from which you can view all of the surrounding area. Once you go through the park entrance, there are just miles of cliffside road. Serpentining through these roads was an exhilerating experience, as a lot of the curves had no guardrails. You simply had to control your vehicle's speed and turn carefully. Every so often, there were viewpoints to stop at, which we did. I even got to climb a few rocks for better views. </p>

      <p> After taking in the whole park, we reminded ourselves that we still needed to look into the possibility of camping somewhere, if that was still our plan. To no one's surprise, all of the camping spots within the park had been reserved. While there are some free campgrounds along highways, they are also first come first serve, meaning they are generally packed if you aren't there well before sundown. Our plan to camp would not pan out, so we chose to drive onward to Provo, UT - just south of Salt Lake City. On the way, we decided if we couldn't camp, we could at least have dinner outside as the sun set. And where better to do that than on the side of a single lane highway? </p>

       <p> After a quick meal, we drove on. Tomorrow, we'd be checking out the Salt Lake itself before taking on a huge drive over to Reno, NV. The end of the trip was closing in fast. </p>
