      <p> And so that brings my trip to a close. After a short, bittersweet plane ride back to MA, I met up with my parents. The first thing I did upon arriving home was to take a shower, trying to keep whatever germs I'd brought from across the country to a minimum. We enjoyed a nice dinner together and I shared a lot of the pictures I shared with you all here. </p>

      <h3><b><u>National Parks Visited: </b></u></h3>
      <p> 1. Hot Springs National Park </br>
          2. White Sands National Park </br>
          3. Petrified Forest National Park (Painted Desert) </br>
          4. Canyonlands National Park (Island in the Sky) </br> </p>

      <h3><b><u>Other Landmarks Visited: </b></u></h3>
      <p> 1. Beale Street, Memphis TN </br>
          2. Lincoln National Forest </br>
          3. Great Salt Lake </br>
          4. Tahoe National Forest </br> </p>

      <p> So after a collective <b>~70 hours</b> of driving, passing through <b>15 states</b>, and approximately <b>4.9k miles</b> traveled, I can now say that I've driven across the country. This is an experience I recommend to anyone and everyone, especially if you've only lived in a coastal city. The country is enormous and, though I'd seen pictures and read about them, these sights and landmarks always felt so distant until now. I will absolutely be doing a trip like this again, hopefully sooner rather than later, because who knows when such an opportunity will come by again. I'm eternally grateful to my friends for inviting me on this trip with them, as there are memories that I will have forever. I hope you've enjoyed my recollection of the trip, I've certainly enjoyed reliving it through blogging. Hope to have some more exciting stuff for you all soon. </p>

      <p> Peace! </p>
