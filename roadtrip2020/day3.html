  <h3>Day 3: </h3>

      <p> Now I know I cheated a little bit by including today's breakfast in yesterday's post, but that's just how uneventful yesterday was. Today, we have pictures again! Following breakfast, we began on our 4.5 hour drive down to Memphis, TN, a place known for Elvis, rock & roll, blues, and the lively Beale St. </p>

      <p> Ah right, we're in a pandemic. While disappointing that the streets weren't full of people and the sound of music, it was a uniquely bizarre and special experience being one of just a handful of groups of people there. And lucky for us, the sound of music wasn't missing for long. </p>

      <p> In a little cutout next to King's Palace Cafe, there was a live band playing the blues to a small crowd of people - socially distanced at separate tables, of course. What a find this was! It made me realize just how long it had been since my last live show, which honestly I can't remember. It might have been Marc Rebillet at the Sinclair? I dunno. </p>

      <p> Seriously, I can't tell you just how awesome it was, to be able to just relax with a beer and listen to some live blues outdoors. On this unusually quiet street, there were still people trying to liven things up, and doing it as safely as they could. After a beer and a few jams, we decided it was time to head back to the car to continue the drive to Arkansas, making sure to tip the band as we left. </p>

      <p> On our way back to the car, we also found a little music shop. I bought my first vinyl (Radiohead - OK Computer OKNOTOK), and a couple of gifts for musician friends back home. It would be a couple of days before I realized, "Oh, yeah, I should get a record player, huh?" We also made sure to say bye to Elvis before leaving. </p>

      <p> The drive to Hot Springs, AK would be another 3 hours from Memphis. It was evening/night shift, so my turn to drive now. It was a fairly quiet drive for the majority of it, elevating to hauntingly quiet as we reached closer to Hot Springs. For about 45 minutes off of the interstate, we just went down winding roads to get to our inn. </p>

      <p> Once we arrived at our room, we decided it would be a good idea to stay here for two nights. We had just spent two very long days driving - why not stay and enjoy Hot Springs National Park and get a chance to sleep in for a night? Once suggested, it was heartily agreed upon by everyone, and so we hopped in bed, excited to not have to drive the next day. </p>
