  <h3>Day 9: </h3>

      <p> Before embarking on the long journey to Reno, we stopped at Penny Ann's Cafe for a hearty breakfast, and even had to pack our remaining pancakes to go. Afterwards, we went to the Great Salt Lake itself to check out the marina and the beach. Looking at reviews of the place, there was a common theme of "it's nice but it smells awful," and boy did it live up to that. Lots of the beach had dried up and large colonies of tiny flies carpeted the sand. Taking steps through the sand caused them all to disperse in sync, almost like dust in the wind. Check out my second selfie of the trip. </p>

      <p> As we returned to our car to head out, we started talking to an older couple that was cleaning their RV in the parking lot. We clearly looked like travelers, and they were amazed we were here from so far away. It was nice to talk to some local folks and drop the "us and them". Honestly, that's one of the biggest lessons from this trip. News and social media tend to feed us a lot of negativity, but there really are normal people everywhere. Hopefully we don't forget that. </p>

      <p> Back in the car, we prepared for a long 8ish hour drive. Normally, I had been taking the evening/night shift for driving, but today I wanted to drive first. With the sun beating down through the driver side window, I got us about 4-5 hours through the trip in almost a single shot. The speed limit for a lot of this highway was 80 mph. Now don't tell anyone, but I miiiiight have hit 110 mph at one point. After the mountains in Utah, there was a large stretch of just pure desert. For miles and miles, nothing could be seen in the distance except for more road. </p>

      <p> Come nighttime, we made it to Reno, NV. We joked about wanting to go do some penny slots and $1 blackjack, but truthfully, we were way too tired to do anything like that. Instead, we found a nice spot for dinner with a lot of different options. I got myself an authentic and delicious thali at a place called... Thali. With one payment, I got free roti and rice refills with my amazing plate of food. </p>

      <p> After dinner, we called it for the night. Tomorrow would be our final day of exploration and adventure, so we wanted to be fully awake and ready. </p>
