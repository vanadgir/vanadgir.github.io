  <h3>Day 2: </h3>

    <p> Not too many pictures taken today. After all, it was a long 11.5 hour drive to Cave City, KY - most of which I spent in the back seat resting up for my turn. We drove through Columbus and Cincinnati, OH, where I eventually took night shift and got us to the motel in Kentucky. Definitely not as homey as my brother's place. However, we had officially passed through into Central Time! </p>

    <p> And honestly, that's about it. We called it a night as soon as we got there and prepared for a shorter, but still significant, drive the next day. Unfortunately for our Mammoth Cave plans, we found out that a large storm would be passing through the area. Not wanting to get stuck in the thunder, lightning, and poor driving conditions that would accompany it, we chose to just push on ahead. Funnily enough, that same storm ended up passing through MA and visited our friends and family back home. </p>

    <p> In the morning, our complimentary breakfast consisted of a granola bar, an apple, a cinnamon cake, and a bottle of water. Since the motel couldn't provide breakfast in their lobby, they were simply handing out lunchbags of assorted breakfast things. Not particularly excited about the foodstuffs they included, we decided that there's no reason to turn down free drinking water for a long trip, so we took our lunchbags and headed to get breakfast at a Cracker Barrel nearby. <p>

    <p> It was okay. The real highlight was seeing someone open carrying while paying for their breakfast. Wouldn't want to be anywhere near that man's bacon, that's for sure. </p>
