  <h3>Day 10: </h3>

      <p> From Reno, we headed out for Lake Tahoe. Right on the border of NV and CA, we would officially be passing into California today. We made plans to pick up breakfast from Ernie's Coffee Shop, a busy spot among all the other attractions in Tahoe and about an hour away. After arriving and picking up our food, we entered into the actual park areas, and sat down to eat along the water at Pope Beach. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever see water as clear as what you can find here at Lake Tahoe. Even as the light waves splashed up onto shore, the view of the bottom was completely clean and unobstructed.  </p>

      <p> We sat and enjoyed the water here for about an hour before cleaning up to go drive around the loop a bit more. Around the lake are many hiking and beach spots, so our plan was to drive clockwise for a bit, staying on the California side. Occasionally, we'd stop at viewpoints along the way, sometimes even trekking into the woods further just for fun. It was pretty busy up here for a Monday, at least to my untrained eye. Perhaps it should be even more busy here were it not for the pandemic. We passed a number of large houses built along the mountainside, likely priced at several millions. Something tells me those houses are worth every penny, considering the views here. </p>

      <p> We continued on to Meek's Bay, another beach, where we sat on the rocks for another half hour. It was a great relaxing experience, meditating there. Taking in all the sounds of this wonderful place, it was very calming and helped to round out and balance the exciting and hectic past few days. After we took it all in, we decided it was time to continue. </p>

      <p> The last leg of our trip would take us through the mountains, with lots of warning signs for the steep grades we'd have to endure. The car groaned as some points, but it was only a little bit farther now. At one point, we got stuck in traffic due to two completely independent accidents. One car with a few minor dents had pulled over on the side of the road, waiting for some sort of assistance. However, he was going to have to wait - further down the road was a massive accident involving an 18-wheeler. The front of this truck appeared to have exploded - metal pieces lay strewn all over the road and the parts of the truck that were still intact were charred and black. It took a while to make it past, but once we did, it was smooth sailing. </p>

      <p> Our trip finally came to a close 3.5 hours later, when we arrived in Oakland. We pulled in to our Airbnb and took a while to finally realize that the trip was over. It was honestly a bit sad, as the last few days had been some of the most spectacular of the trip. I was still riding the high of being able to see so much of the country I'd been waiting to see, and so it was tough to accept that I'd be heading home soon. But arriving here was not all bad! Tomorrow would be my free day here in the Bay Area, and so I'd made plans to borrow the car and see some other friends. </p>

      <p> Technically Day 11: </p>

      <p> On my free day, I met with one of our family friends for lunch, and then met with two of my online friends for dinner. In between, I stopped by Presidio Park in San Francisco, hoping to get some sort of view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Unfortunately, it was an extremely foggy day, so all I could hear were the sounds of the ocean waves and occasional fog horns. Not a big deal - I'd already seen the Golden Gate Bridge a few times on previous trips, and the park had a certain charm of its own when shrouded in fog. I arrived back at the Airbnb in the middle of the night and went straight to bed. Tomorrow would be a day of no schedule, no driving, and relaxing only. Well, and packing for my flight the following day. </p>
