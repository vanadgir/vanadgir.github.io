  <h3>Day 7: </h3>

      <p> After some discussion in the morning, we eventually decided that the Petrified Forest was a stop we could not miss, although we would still have to skip the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park. Unfortunate, but it would was a necessary sacrifice to make good time on the rest of the trip. From Albuquerque, the trip would be about 3.5 hours along the historic Route 66, now I-40. The Petrified Forest is actually found within a larger landmark known as the Painted Desert. Aptly named, the layers of sand and stone had shades of blue/lavender, red/orange, grey, and likely more at other strata. Honestly, it's hard to put into words the beauty and wonder of this place, so I'll just let the pictures speak for themselves. Enjoy. </p>

      <p> I wish I had more to say about the Painted Desert / Petrified Forest, other than to go there if you ever have the chance. Despite the number of hours we spent there, there was still more we could have seen, but unfortunately we had to prepare to leave since the park was preparing to close soon. At the picnic area near the exit, we took some time to make noodles on our portable propane stove - it was quite the janky setup. But there's something special about the taste of roadside noodles made in a rush. </p>

      <p> Our next stop was Canyonlands in Utah, so we started our approximately 4 hour drive. This night gave us a bit of a scare, since we were struggling to find lodging. Every place we called was completely booked and meant that we would have to continue driving into the night. Finally, in Blanding, UT, we were able to secure the final two rooms at the Four Corners Inn. Up until now, I could safely that the Petrified Forest was my favourite stop of the trip. It wouldn't be long for something to rival it, though, since tomorrow we would be seeing Canyonlands. </p>
