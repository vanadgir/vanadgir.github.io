          <h3> The Atonal Matrix </h3>
          <p> In general, composed music follows certain tonal rules that guide the composer when writing chord progressions, melody lines, and entire harmonies.  The word "tonal" usually implies some notes are more prominent than others, such as the root (I) or the dominant (V).  However, in atonal music, no note is used more often than another, meaning <i>there is no root.</i>  This 12x12 atonal matrix gives us a way to write music so that this rule can be followed. </p>
          <p> First, the composer has to select the "initial row": a 12-note sequence that uses each of the 12 notes in Western music only once.  Second, the inverse of this row is placed in the first column.  To find the inverse, first we assign numerical values to the notes in our initial row.  That is, the root is called 0, one half step up is 1, another half step is 2, and so on until 11.  The value placed in the inverse column will simply be (12 - initial row).  Third, all other cells are filled in by adding up the top-most row value with the left-most column value. Remember that this is mod12, so any sum larger than 12 is replaced with the proper value.  Now that a number value has been put into every cell of this matrix, we can convert it back to notes to make it more readible.  This completed matrix is what we can now use to write an atonal piece. </p>
          <p><b>Rules:</b>
            <ol>
              <li> Select any row/column in your palette </li>
              <li> Once you begin a row, you must follow it to completion </li>
              <li> You must play all the pitches in order </li>
              <li> You may not skip any pitches, and you may not repeat any pitches </li>
              <li> Notes may occur in any octave and may last any duration </li>
              <li> You may begin two or more notes simultaneously as long as they occur sequentially in the row. </li>
              <li> Any number of rows may be played concurrently </li>
            </ol>
<p> Because of the way we generated the matrix, these rules ensure that no note gets used more than another, meaning no note can be considered the root.

		<p><br> Unfortunately, I am not sure how to add interactivity to the embedded version of this Google sheet, but if you would like to change the 12-note matrix, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14gfzP2VKucyH8DyjwBaFddX6ZatoVaD3HPYQsj6u2Do/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> click here </a> to open the document and change it directly.  You must change the original row to your own 12-tone sequence (using each note only once), and then change the Legend to reflect the new numerical assignments.  Then the final matrix will change on its own.  Once you've done that, well... that's the easy part.  The hard part is actually writing something that sounds good! </p>
