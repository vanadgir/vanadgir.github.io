      <h3> Welcome! </h3>
      <p align="justify">Hey there, I'm Varun. Thanks for stopping by! Take a peek at the <a href="https://vanadgir.github.io/aboutme.html">About Me</a> and <a href="https://vanadgir.github.io/projects.html">Projects</a> pages if you are interested in looking at my Résumé and other things I've worked on. <br></p>

      <h3> What I'm Up To </h3>
      <p align="justify">  As of Jan 12, 2024, I have officially completed my MS in Computer Science from Boston University. I completed a lot of fun and interesting projects in my time there, some of which are in my portfolio. I am now looking for work in positions such as data analyst or software developer in the Boston area, but I am open to relocating.</p>

      <p align="justify"> In the first few months of 2022, I began co-developing <a href="https://dndler.app" target="_blank">The Dndler</a> - a character generator and randomizer for tabletop games. What started as a personal passion project has now grown into a fun and useful tool made by myself and two of my friends. I hope you will check it out and watch as it continues to grow. Please send me any feedback you have as well! </p>

      <p align="justify"> During Summer 2021, I completed the Applied Data Science Program through MIT Professional Education, and you can find my Capstone on my Projects page. It was an awesome experience where I was able to refresh my math and statistics knowledge while fully immersing myself in machine learning. </p>

      <p align="justify"> Near the end of 2020, I drove from Central Massachusetts to San Francisco, CA with a couple friends, or <a href="https://www.varun.pro/roadtrip2020/"> Roadtrip2020 </a> as I like to call it. You'll find pictures and writeups of my time traveling the country, hope you enjoy! </p>

      <h3>Are you making a video game or short film? </h3>
      <p> And are you interested in having an original score? <br> <br>
        Check out my EP on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1SOnl0iA2kZJb86d3VnlX0?si=thNS2KZ6SAqSqCKZxmOJtQ" target="_blank">Spotify</a> to see if I might be a good fit for your project! <br>

        I'm also on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/barntunes" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, if you'd like to listen to some of my older work or just say Hello.
