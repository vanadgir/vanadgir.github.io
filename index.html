      <p>Welcome!</p>

      <p>Thanks for visiting my corner of the internet. My name is Varun and I am a developer and musician from Massachusetts. I recently acquired my MS in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Analytics, and I am now looking for work as a Data Analyst or Software Developer. If you need a motivated and creative problem solver for your team, look no further! For my work history and contact information, please see my <a href="/docs/VNResume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.</p> 

      <p>My most recent work is my final project for a full stack web development course during my MS program at Boston University. <a href="https://www.varun.pro/drawble" target="_blank">drawble</a> is a collaborative drawing and chat application for making doodles with your friends, built primarily with web sockets and Google Auth. Both in and outside of school, I have collaborated on a number of projects with other students and friends, most of which can be found in my <a href="/projects">Portfolio</a>.</p>
      
      <p> In addition to programming, I also enjoy writing music. I have been commissioned for a few tracks in the past and am open to new projects, whether for your video game or short film. The majority of my music is on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/barntunes" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a>, but you can also find my EP on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1SOnl0iA2kZJb86d3VnlX0?si=7SDAyX4BS5WQnSV95Rchtw" target="_blank">Spotify</a>. Reach out to me on SoundCloud or my email and we can discuss further!</p>
